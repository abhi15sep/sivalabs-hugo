While developing database driven applications using some ORM framework, some people prefer 
Object first approach and others follow DB first approach. I prefer DB first approach.

So, let us start listing down all the domain entities in our JCart application domain.

	
  * Product
  * Category
  * Customer
  * Order
  * OrderItem
  * Cart
  * Address
  * User
  * Role
  * Permission


Let us create the database tables as follows:

Though we identified **Cart** as a domain entity, we are not creating the table for holding the Cart details.
 We are going to take the simple approach of storing the active cart details in **HttpSession** only. 
 But in real applications it is strongly recommended to store them in some persistent storage like database.
