Now that we have completed the most difficult part (writing Introduction to technical article series is much 
harder than you think!!), so let's start the fun part. **Coding**!!!


NOTE: It is going to be a fast paced tutorial. Obviously we can't cover every little bit of all 
the technologies used in our application. So I would suggest to explore more on individual technologies like Spring, 
Thymeleaf on your own. I would strongly suggest to checkout the code from https://github.com/sivaprasadreddy/jcart.git 
if you want to see the complete code as we are going to trim the code snippets for brevity.

We will start with Iteration-1 UseCases implementation, progressively building the JCart application.

As part of Iteration-1, we will be implementing the following UseCases:
