For our JCart application development we will be using the following Softwares/Tools.
	
. http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[JDK 8]
. https://spring.io/tools/sts/all[SpringSource Tool Suite (STS)]
. https://www.mysql.com/downloads/[MySQL]
. https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git]
. https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven]
. https://jenkins-ci.org/[Jenkins]
. http://www.sonarqube.org/[SonarQube]
. https://httpd.apache.org/[Apache] / https://www.nginx.com/[Nginx ] WebServer

I am not going to explain how to install JDK or MySQL because there are plenty of articles you can find on internet.

If you are using Ubuntu based Linux Operating System then you can refer my article 
link:/my-development-environment-setup-on-linux[My Development Environment SetUp on Linux] to setup Java development tool chain.
