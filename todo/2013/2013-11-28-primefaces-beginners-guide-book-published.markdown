I am glad to announce that my second book PrimeFaces Beginner's Guide is published.  
  
As many of us know PrimeFaces is leading JSF component library for JSF based web applications. This PrimeFaces Beginner's Guide book targets the Java developers with basic knowledge on JSF and jQuery and covers most of the commonly used PrimeFaces components.  
  


<blockquote>Good news is that PrimeFaces Beginner's Guide book covers the latest **PrimeFaces 4.0** version features such as **Client Side Validations (CSV) framework**, **Dialog Framework**, **Search Expressions**, **Sticky Component** and many other enhancement as well.</blockquote>
