Now that we have completed the most difficult part (writing Introduction to technical article series is much harder than you think!!), so let's start the fun part. **Coding**!!!



<blockquote>**Note:** It is going to be a fast paced tutorial. Obviously we can't cover every little bit of all the technologies used in our application. So I would suggest to explore more on individual technologies like Spring, Thymeleaf on your own.</blockquote>



_I would strongly suggest to checkout the code from [https://github.com/sivaprasadreddy/jcart.git](https://github.com/sivaprasadreddy/jcart.git) if you want to see the complete code as we are going to trim the code snippets for brevity._

We will start with Iteration-1 UseCases implementation, progressively building the JCart application.

As part of Iteration-1, we will be implementing the following UseCases:



	
  * [Initial Code Setup](http://sivalabs.in/2015/12/jcart-initial-code-setup.html)

	
  * [Domain Modelling and Database Designing](http://sivalabs.in/2015/12/jcart-domain-modelling-and-database-designing.html)

	
  * [Creating JPA Entities](http://sivalabs.in/2015/12/jcart-create-jpa-entities.html)

	
  * [Admin UI Layout SetUp](http://sivalabs.in/2015/12/jcart-admin-ui-layout-setup.html)

	
  * [Configuring Spring Security](http://sivalabs.in/2015/12/jcart-configuring-spring-security.html)

	
  * [Email Service Setup](http://sivalabs.in/2015/12/jcart-email-service-setup.html)

	
  * [Admin Forgot Password](http://sivalabs.in/2015/12/jcart-admin-forgot-password.html)

	
  * [Admin Reset Password](http://sivalabs.in/2015/12/jcart-admin-reset-password.html)

	
  * [Configuring HTTPS SSL/TLS](http://sivalabs.in/2015/12/jcart-configuring-https-ssltls.html)
