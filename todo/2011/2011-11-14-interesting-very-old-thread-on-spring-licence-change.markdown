While surfing internet today i came across very old thread discussing on Spring licence change and I enjoyed reading the thread :-)

I don't worry even if Spring becomes a commercial software because Spring source code already taught me how to write better code.  
  
Thanks to Rod Johnson & Team for the wonderful framework.  
  
Thanks,
