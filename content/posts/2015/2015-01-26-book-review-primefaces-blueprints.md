    PrimeFaces Blueprint book followed the approach of explaining the features with appropriate example applications. PrimeFaces provides more than 100 rich UI components with lot of customization options.

  </div>
  
  <div>
    Instead of explaining all these components individually, the book authors explained how to use various PrimeFaces components together by developing 9 different small applications.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    This book covers usage of components such as basic form field components and advanced components like DataTables, Data Exporting features, PrimeFaces Push etc with plenty of code snippets.

  <div>
    Also authors covered how to effectively use the Eclipse and NetBeans IDEs to get AutoCompletion for JSF/PrimeFaces and also touched upon using NetBeans PrimeFaces CRUD generator plugin.

  <div>
    I find this book very useful for beginners to intermediate level developers and even advanced&nbsp;PrimeFaces&nbsp;users&nbsp;can also learn few advanced things like how to customize&nbsp;PrimeFaces&nbsp;css styles,&nbsp;using Push technology etc.

    I would recommend the PrimeFaces Blueprints book to anyone who wants to get started with PrimeFaces.
