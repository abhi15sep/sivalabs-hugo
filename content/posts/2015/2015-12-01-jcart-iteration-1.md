Now that we have completed the most difficult part (writing Introduction to technical article series is much harder than you think!!), so let&#8217;s start the fun part. **Coding**!!!

> **Note:** It is going to be a fast paced tutorial. Obviously we can&#8217;t cover every little bit of all the technologies used in our application. So I would suggest to explore more on individual technologies like Spring, Thymeleaf on your own.

_<span style="color: #0000ff;">I would strongly suggest to checkout the code from <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://github.com/sivaprasadreddy/jcart.git" target="_blank">https://github.com/sivaprasadreddy/jcart.git</a> if you want to see the complete code as we are going to trim the code snippets for brevity.</span>_

We will start with Iteration-1 UseCases implementation, progressively building the JCart application.

As part of Iteration-1, we will be implementing the following UseCases:
