Well, NetBeansIDE 7.3 is out with plenty of new features, tremendous performance improvements.  
In addition to the great support for Java/JavaEE technologies, NetBeansIDE 7.3 comes with decent support for HTML5, Groovy, PHP, C++ as well. If you are skeptic with older versions of NetBeans like 5.x and never again look at NetBeansIDE, I would strongly suggest you to take a look at latest NeaBeans releases specifically 6.9.x&nbsp;on wards.

However, I wish NetBeans should have following features which greatly increases its adoption:  
<span style="font-size: large;"><b>1. NetBeansIDE as a zipped bundle:</b>&nbsp;</span>  
You may ask how does it matters?!!. Think about the&nbsp;enthusiastic&nbsp;developers in so called Big MNCs without having Admin privileges to install any new&nbsp;software.

If the company is using other IDEs and the developer wants to show to his team mates how NetBeans is better than the existing IDE, he can&#8217;t because he himself can&#8217;t install NetBeans on his machine.&nbsp;If the developer rise a ticket to install NetBeans 7.3 then he may also have to give a reason why he need that software. If he give reason as &#8220;I want to show how NetBeansIDE is better than our current IDE and motivate the team to move to NetBeans&#8221; then chances for rejecting the ticket is High ðŸ™‚

So IMHO, being able to download, extract and use will definitely increase its adoption.

<span style="color: red; white-space: pre;"><b>PS: We can get NetBeansIDE as OS Independent Zip. Plz see the comments.</b></span>  
<span style="white-space: pre;"><br /></span>**<span style="font-size: large;">2. Support for latest Application Server Adapters:&nbsp;</span>**  
When I first realized that NetBeans 7.x also doesn&#8217;t have support for JBoss AS 6/7 I was really surprised. And when I heard that NetBeansIDE 7.3 comes with JBoss AS support I was very happy and wanted to hookup my JBossAS7 with NetBeansIDE&nbsp;7.3. But when I came to know that NetBeans 7.3 supports JBoss 5.x only for now, I was really surprised why NB team spent time on providing support for older JBoss version.

After expressing this concern on Twitter(@sivalabs), Geertjan Wielenga (@geertjanw) replied to my tweet saying support for JBoss AS7 is on the way and probabily comes in-built with next release of NetBeans.  
 <span style="white-space: pre;"></span>  
**<span style="font-size: large;">3. More plugins support:&nbsp;</span>**  
Lets be honest and say Eclipse has rich plugin support compared to NetBeans.&nbsp;Of course&nbsp;you can say quantity is not matter, quality matters and its true ðŸ™‚

Sometimes I do weird things like creating a JavaEE project, generating Entities from Database Tables, creating REST Endpoints in NetBeans and import the code into Eclipse and work with it. I do like this because GOD knows when Eclipse&#8217;s JBoss Tool plugin works properly ðŸ™‚ Anyway, NetBeans needs more plugins support.
