How much crap you are keeping because &#8220;You might need it in future&#8221;?

I am planning to move to a new house in a couple of weeks, so I started packing things and throwing away unnecessary stuff.

In the process of identifying unnecessary stuff I realized how much crap I am keeping in my house thinking it might be required in future.

But I only came to know that I have these things while looking for waste to throw away. Lots of stuff..CDs/DVDs with JDK1.4/1.5, Eclipse 3.2, Spring 2.5.zip, MySQL4.x, WebLogic Server 10, Utilities(AVG 2007, MS OFFICE 2003, Winamp/VLC players), broken DVD Writer and HardDrive and lots of clothes which I can&#8217;t wear anymore, many other electronic goods which are not working and many more.

**While cleaning up all these things and throwing away all unnecessary things I got a thought like &#8220;Aren&#8217;t we doing the same mistake while developing software?&#8221;.**

First we keep adding unnecessary features assuming we might need them in future to support all types of *bilities(Scalability, Extendability,Maintainability etc). After a while &#8220;That future purpose features&#8221; becomes a &#8220;Dark Room&#8221; where no one knows what exactly in there and many people don&#8217;t even bother to know why it is there in the first place.

Even horrible thing is you might be in a situation where &#8220;whenever you add some new required feature you might have to add some code/configuration in that future purpose module as well&#8221;. You don&#8217;t know why you have to do it or you have to do it just because to pass the build.

Moving to a new place quickly is painful when you have unnecessary luggage. Being Agile is very difficult if you have unnecessary future purpose code about what you forgot a long time ago.

Less luggage, more comfort. Applies both to personal life and Software Development as well üôÇ
