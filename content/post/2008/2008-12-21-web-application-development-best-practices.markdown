Web Application Development Best Practices:

  


  

  1. Follow consistency in naming the project artifacts like Java class names, JSP names etc.
  

  2. Maintain the standard way of handling exceptions in different layers.
  

  3. Have a single access point for Configuration Constants.
  

  4. Take care about page navigation. Use forwarding and redirecting carefully.
  

  5. Always try to pull out the repeted code blocks and make them seperate methods.
