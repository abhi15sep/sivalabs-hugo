Hi, 

My name is Siva and by profession I am a Software Developer.
I do blog about the technology stuff that I learned at http://sivalabs.in. 

I wanted to start blogging about non-technical stuff and here I am with my new blog http://sivaprasadreddy.github.io.

Going forward you can find my thoughts on various interesting things in life here.

Stay tuned :-)

```
public class HelloWorld
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Welcome to my new blog!!");
    }
}
```
