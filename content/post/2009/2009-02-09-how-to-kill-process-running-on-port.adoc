Hi All,  + 
Many of the Java developers frequently facing some problems with ports.  

Ex: If JBoss server has started and closed accidentally without properly shutdown process , 
several processes will remain running on some ports which will causes Port Already binded kind of exceptions.  


In that kind of situations, we can forcefully kill a process running on a port as follows:  

**Get the PID of that process**

d:/>netstat -ao  
  
**kill the process**  

d:/>taskkill /F /PID p_id
