Today While surfing net I reached Impala framework's source code at googlecode.  
I haven't gone through Impala framework. But there are plenty of Java Utilities in its core module which could be helpful for our day to day work.  
  
FileUtils.java  
InstantiationUtils.java  
MemoryUtils.java  
ObjectMapUtils.java  
ObjectUtils.java  
ParseUtils.java  
PathUtils.java  
PropertyUtils.java  
ReflectionUtils.java  
ResourceUtils.java  
SerializationUtils.java  
StringBufferUtils.java  
URLUtils.java  
XMLDomUtils.java  
  
Just thought of sharing the link.
