The Father of Java James Gosling announced that he joined Google on March 28, 2011.  
There is no need to tell about how great James Gosling is and how much he served for the Java community. And we can't imagine our lives(at least in corporates) without Google. Also Google is the best place for those who are enthusiastic towards technology and innovation. So we can expect many more great innovative things from Google :-)
