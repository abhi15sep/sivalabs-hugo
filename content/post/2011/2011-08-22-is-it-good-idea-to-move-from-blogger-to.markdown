Hello Guys,  
Blogger is very easy to use blogging tool which I really enjoy blogging all these days.  
But as my blog is technical blog i need to post code snippets and I thought it would be good to use SyntaxHighlighter. I used http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter.  
  
But while posting HTML or XML code, Java generics I need to escape all < and > symbols which is tedious process.  
  
Yesterday I tried using Wordpress and it's syntax highlighting support is awesome.  
We don't need to configure anything. Just surround the code snippets with   

    
    [sourcecode language="java"]. Thats it. 

It is rendering java, html, xml without needing to escape special chars.  

    
     

Is it a good idea to move from Blogger to Wordpress?  
What features of blogger I will miss if I move to Wordpress?  
  
Thanks,  
Siva
