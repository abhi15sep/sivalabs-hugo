The creator of C programming language and UNIX operating system expired on Oct 8th 2011.  
C and UNIX are the terms which doesn't need any introductions and can't imagine today's modern technologies without them.  
  
Till my secondary education i was passionate about mathematics and wanted to become a mathematician. But in my graduation(B.Sc computer science) I used computer for the first time starting with Pascal.  
Then I learn C programming language and then I fall in love with programming.  
  
If there is no C then there is no Java, J2EE, Spring, Hibernate, Grails, Scala or whatever the hot technologies out there in market.
