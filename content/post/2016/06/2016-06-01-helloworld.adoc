Hi, 

My name is Siva and by profession I am a Software Developer primarily working on Java platform.
I used to blog about the technology stuff that I learned at *www.sivalabs.in*. 
I wanted to move to Hugo blogging platform because of its rich features, 
and here I am with my new blog http://sivalabs.github.io.

Going forward you can find various Java related things, my thoughts on technology/life and simple tips also.

Stay tuned :-)
