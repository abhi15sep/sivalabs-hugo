At times we stuck with some weird problem which doesn't make any sense and gives no clue where to start debugging the issue also.

If you find yourself in that situation, follow the following 3 steps.

### Step 1: Lock the system and go out for a quick walk.

*Why this works:*

When you are visually looking at the code and mentally decided it is correct then your brain can't think out-of-the-box.
When you are not looking at code your brain starts thinking what can be the possible reason that is causing issue.

### Step 2: Explain the issue to someone who works in the same field but not familar with the language/framework you are having issue with.

*Why this works:*

When you try to explain the problem to someone who is not faimilar with the language/framework then generally you start explaining the fundamentals of "How the framework works" to give a context of the problem. Most likely you get a clue on what is causing the issue while explaining the problem itself.

### Step 3: Look at the balance amount you have to pay for your HouseLoan

*Why this works:*

No logic is required. It just works!!
